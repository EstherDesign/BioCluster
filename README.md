Please find our manuscript submitted to the [6th IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization](http://biovis.net/2016/index.html) (BioVis 2016) [here](https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/BioLinker/blob/master/figures/Dang2016BioLinker.pdf).

Try BioLinker [Web demo](http://www2.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/BioLinker/).

BioLinker is an interactive visualization system that helps users to perform bottom-up exploration of complex protein interaction networks. Five interconnected views provide the user with a range of ways to explore pathway data: Overview/ protein selector, context view, main view, publication view, and conflict matrix.
